      <dt><strong>Biography</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I was born on May 7th, 2001, in Bayelsa State. I'm a 6'2" dark skinned with narrow-set eyes, mild athlectic build, broad shoulders individual that plays quite a number of sports.
        </p>
        <p>I had my primary education in the south, secondary education in the north central, and Bsc. in the west, or at least i started it there. I enjoyed moving around cause where i grew up wasn't the most exposed in mindset, and was filled with occulic activities at almost every age group. Even in such places i was always drawn towards a better life, and anything gadget or technology came fun and relatively easy to me. I'll like think of myself as a simple minded problem detective. Being able to detect or solve problems are two distinct skill which the former comes easy to be. To solve a problem you must first detect it, then you solve or rather improve it, depending on the scenario, i am, that guy.
        </p>
        <p>Among other things, i love Anime, Sports, video games, and Gadgets. My no.1 anime currently and probably forever no.1 is <b><em>'One Piece'</em></b>. Table tennis and football ranked as my favourites, and as expected i enjoy playing FIFA.</p>
